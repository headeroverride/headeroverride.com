      "Header Override helps developers, QA teams, and support engineers modify HTTP headers and cookies from the browser for scoped debugging and testing workflows."
  },
  {
    question: "Is Header Override an alternative to ModHeader?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Header Override is an open-source, lightweight ModHeader alternative for modifying request headers, response headers, request cookies, and response cookies with local browser rules."
  },
  {
    question: "Are rules sent to a server?",
    answer:
      "No. Rules are stored locally in browser extension storage and are used only to apply the header or cookie changes you configure."
  },
  {
    question: "Can rules target specific URLs?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Header and cookie rules can be scoped with browser-supported URL filter patterns, so changes apply only to matching requests."
  },
  {
    question: "Why does Header Override request access to websites?",
    answer:
      "Header Override needs access to all URLs because you can create rules for any website and scope them with URL filters. The extension processes your rules locally and does not send your rules, browsing activity, headers, cookies, or website content to the developer or third parties."

            Header Override keeps the workflow deliberately narrow: add a rule,
            choose request or response behavior, scope it where needed, and
            let the extension apply it. Profiles keep separate projects tidy
            when one browser needs several debugging setups.
          </p>
          <p>
            Use the Header Override extension in Chrome, Edge, and Firefox to
            modify headers with local rules for API debugging, staging checks,
            and QA workflows.
